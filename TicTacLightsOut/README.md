This was a project I had done, originally starting on 11/20/2025 and completed on 11/21/2025. (Updated periodically)
This was based off of two old assignments I had done for my Web Design class at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology: Linear Lights Out and Tic Tac Toe.

I decided to combine both of them into a single game with the option to switch between them. I have since added several new games over the past few weeks, such as Concentration and Chō-Han.
Other changes include:
-Adding a move counter to Linear Lights Out
-Adding a help button that explains the rules of the game currently being played.

In the future, I plan on:
-Adding a 1P option to Tic Tac Toe
-Adding the option to play the original Lights Out (and not just a linear version)
-Customizing the dice in Chō-Han (such as number of sides and number of dice)
-Custom Concentration
-Adding more games
-Improving accessibility and overall design of the page
-Improve descriptions given by help button
