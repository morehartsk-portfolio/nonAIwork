This was a project I had done, starting on 11/20/2025 and completed on 11/21/2025.
This was based off of two old assignments I had done for my Web Design class at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology: Linear Lights Out and Tic Tac Toe.

I decided to combine both of them into a single game with the option to switch between them.
In the future, I plan on:
-Refactoring the existing JavaScript code into several seperate files for ease of readability
-Adding more features to existing games
-Adding more games
-Improving accessibility and overall design of the page
