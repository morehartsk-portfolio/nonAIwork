CabbageWorld was a game created in Unity as a class project for my CSSE352 class at Rose-Hulman.
This is an archived copy of my CSSE352 git repository. In addition to CabbageWorld, there are several other homework assignments inside the repository. This includes a game jam submission that involves an upgrade system, audio, and an in-game timer.
Code was written in C# for the Unity engine.
